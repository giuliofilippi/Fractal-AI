# Fractal-AI
The goal is for this to become a research project, exploring the possible links between AI and Fractal Geometry.

Some possible ideas are:
- Exploring Neural Networks with Fractal architecture
- Training Neural Networks to recognize Fracgtal patterns
- Enhancing Fractal features in input images using DeepDream like methods

# DeepDream
Some of us will have heard of and used software such as DeepDream. Such programs start with an existing neural network trained on a specific task, such as object recognition. They then modifies the network's internal representations by optimizing the input image to maximize the activation of specific neurons or layers within the network. By iteratively adjusting the image based on the network's response, the program produces images that exhibit exaggerated patterns and textures.
